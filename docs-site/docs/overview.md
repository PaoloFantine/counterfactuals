# Counterfactuals for Machine Learning Models

Interpreting Machine Learning (ML) models is not always straightforward. You might wonder: *Why did the model give this specific response?*  

Some models, like linear regression or decision trees, are inherently interpretable — you can see how each feature affects the outcome.  
But many ML models capture complex, nonlinear relationships. For most users, the key question is not just *why*, but *how could the outcome be changed?*

Imagine a few scenarios:

- A loan application is rejected. The applicant wants to know what they could change to get approval.  
- A health screening predicts a high risk factor. A patient wants to know actionable steps to improve their health outcome.  
- A data scientist wants to ensure the model is fair and aligns with business rules.

**Counterfactuals** provide answers to these questions.  

> A counterfactual is the answer to: *"What changes to the features would result in a different, desired outcome?"*

## Example

Suppose a simple loan application model predicts whether a loan will be approved (1) or denied (0).  

| Feature           | Original Applicant | Counterfactual Suggestion |
|------------------|-----------------|-------------------------|
| Age               | 25              | 25                      |
| Annual Income     | $30,000         | $45,000                 |
| Credit Score      | 600             | 650                     |
| Loan Approved?    | 0               | 1                       |


*Figure 1: Original applicant vs counterfactual suggestion.*


In this case, the counterfactual shows that the model would approve the loan if the applicant increased their income to $45,000 and improved their credit score to 650.  
Notice that the age does not need to change — the counterfactual only modifies the features that influence the outcome.

This repository provides Python tools to generate such counterfactual explanations:

- Giving transparency into how ML models work.
- Helping consumers take actionable steps.
- Supporting auditing for fairness and compliance.
